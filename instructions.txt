The python codes are in the folder src (training_models.py, evaluation.py, plots.py), except the Jupyter notebook (EDA.ipynb) which is just in the main folder.

metrics_1 contains the .csv file results from the evaluation
plots contains all the plots (bar charts mainly)
no .joblib files are located in the repo because they are too big (over 12GB in total)
